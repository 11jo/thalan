1. Introduction
This mod compatible with BG:TotSC, BGT-WeiDU, EET, BG:EE and EasyTutu. If you use mod Northern Tales of the Sword Coast BGT-Weidu,
Thalantyr Item Upgrade should be installed after Northern Tales of the Sword Coast.
In this mod Thalantyr, all  known magician from High Hedge, can make new items.
Also he has on sale practically all containers from BG2.
I have only tested this version of the mod with BGT100-Install, Baldurdash-WeiDU v1.5, BP-BGT Worldmap v5,
DSotSC4BGTWeidu180, NTotSC4BGTWeidu140 (see the warning is higher), TGC1e and SecretOfBoneHillv201.
It was not marked any problems with compatibility.


2. Installation 
Standard for WeiDU mods. Unpack contents of archive in a directory with game, and start SETUP-thalan.exe.

8. Most important differences between BG1:TotSC version and BGT/Tutu:

::1:: "Bags of holding" are not implemented in BG1,

::2:: Graphical effect by upgrading of items is different as on BG2 engine,

::3:: Items properties changes:

_a/ ~Boots of the Thief 'Fast Legs'~:
   Hide in Shadows Bonus: +35%
instead
   Move Silently Bonus: +20%
   Hide in Shadows Bonus: +15%
like in ~Boots of Shadow~ in BG1, there is no "Move Silently" parameter in BG1

_b/ ~Sword of the Murderer~:
   Equipped Ability:
   15 % chance of each hit to paralyse a victim on 2 roundes (no save)
instead
   Equipped Ability:
   +1 to backstab multiplier
   10 % chance of each hit to paralyse a victim on 2 roundes (no save)
There is no opcode for backstab bonus in BG1

::4:: Some items +KP are added to ITEMEXCL.2DA in BG1:

~Improved Shield Amulet~
~Improved Cloak of Non-Detection~
~Ring of Free Action +1~
~Ring of Free Action +2~

::5:: Inventory BAMS from ~Ring of Free Action +1~ and ~Ring of Free Action +2~
 are slightly recolored to distinguish from "normal" ring of free action.
